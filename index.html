                        Big O is the way we anaylze how efficient algorithms (or code in this case) without getting too mired in the details. We can model how much time any function is going to take given <em>n</em> inputs, but in reality we're intested in the order of magnitude of the number and necessarily of the exact figure.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Example: I don't particularly care if a function takes 300 milliseconds versus 330 milliseconds given 1,000 inputs, but I <em>do</em> care if it takes 300 millseconds versus 30 seconds. This would be a difference in an order of magnitude, or basically we're saying we only care if the difference is pretty large.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Enter Big O. Think of the O as a vacuum that sucks in all the unimportant information and just leaves you with the important stuff. Let's look at a purely mathemtical perspective for a second. Say we have the equation <code>3x² + x + 1</code>. If we plug in 5, the first term will be 75, the second term will be 5, and the third will be 1. In other words, most of the piece of the pie comes from the first term, to the point we can just ignore the other terms. If we plug in huge numbers, it becomes even more apparent. IE if we do 5,000,000, the first term is 75,000,000,000,000, the second is 5,000,000, and the last 1. A huge gap.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Hence this is what Big O does; we ignore the little parts and concentrate on the big parts. Keeping with <code>3x² + x + 1</code>, the Big O for this equation would be <code>O(n²)</code> where O is just absorbing all the other fluff (including the factor on the biggest term.) Just grab the biggest term. So for <em>n</em> terms, it's going take us n*n time to go through our inputs. So let's see how to derive this from an algorithm.
                    </p>

                    <pre><code>
function crossAdd(input) {
    var answer = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
        var goingUp = input[i];
        var goingDown = input[input.length-1-i];
        answer.push(goingUp + goingDown);
    }
    return answer;
}

                    </code></pre>

                    <p>
                        This is <code>O(n)</code> because we go through all the inputs once in a loop.
                    </p>

                    <pre><code>
function find(needle, haystack) {
    for (int i=0; i < haystack.length; i++) {
        if (haystack[i] === needle) return true;
    }
}

                    </code></pre>

                    <p>
                        Still <code>O(n)</code>. Unless we say otherwise, we're assuming worst case scenario. In this worst case, the needle would be the last element.
                    </p>

                    <pre><code>
function makeTuples(input) {
    var answer = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
        for (var j = 0; j < input.length; j++) {
            answer.push([input[i], input[j]]);
        }
    }
    return answer;
}
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>
                        This would be <code>O(n²)</code>. For every input, we have to go through a full loop inside of another full loop, meaning we're doing a lot of work! This is the trick: look for loops. A loop inside of a loop inside of a loop would likewise be <code>O(n³)</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If we have no loops and just do something and exit/return, then it's said we're doing it in constant time, or <code>O(1)</code>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We'll get more into it later, but you can also have <code>O(log n)</code> if a code employs a divide-and-conquer strategy (often recursive,) meaning as you add more terms, the increases in time as you add input diminshes. We'll talk more about that with merge and quick sort.
                    </p>

                        Recursion is when you define something in terms of itself. Has anyone ever used the word you wanted defined in the definition that they gave you? "What is a computer?" "It's something that computes things." This would be a <em>recursive</em> definition.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When we talk about recursion in computer science, we are talking about a function that calls itself. This technique is especially adept at some problems because of its ability to maintain state at different levels of recursion.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While recursion can make the code very simple for some problems, it inherently carries a potentially large footprint with it as everytime you call the function, it adds another call to the stack. Some problems therefore are better solved in a slightly-more-complicated-but-more-effecient way of iteration (loops) instead of recursion.

                        Our first sort! This is often the easiest to conceptualize and a natural way for the brain to think about sorting so it's typical to do bubble sort first. It's also amongst the least efficient in terms of worst case scenario.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In bubble sort, we're going to loop through the array and compare each index with the index next to it. If the those two numbers are out of order (the lesser index's value is greater than the greater index's value) we swap those two numbers' places in the array. We keep looping over that array until everything is in place and nothing was swapped during the last iteration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What's the Big O on this? Well, there's an inner loop to check to see if indexes need to be swapped, and an outer loop that's just checking to see if anything was swapped. That would be make it <code>O(n²)</code>. Not efficent, but a great learning tool. You'll never use bubble sort for anything serious.

                        Insertion sort is a step more complex but a bit more useful than bubble sort and is occasionally useful. The worst case scenario for it is similar to bubble sort's but its best case makes it suited for times when you're pretty sure a list <em>almost</em> sorted or likely already sorted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We're going to start at the beginning of the list and assume we have a sorted list of length 1 where the first element is only sorted element. We're then going to grab the second element, and insert it into the correct spot in our sorted list, either the 0 index or the 1 index, depending if it's smaller or larger than our first element. We now have a sorted list of length 2. We then continue on down the line, inserting elements in our sorted side of the list as the unsorted side dwindles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What's the Big O? There's an inner loop that goes over your sorted list to find the correct place to insert your item, and an outer loop to go over all the numbers. Two loops means <code>O(n²)</code>. However since if your list is sorted or nearly so, it can be <code>O(n)</code> in a best case scenario and thus well adapted to that scenario.

                        Our first divide-and-conquer algorithm! Merge sort is actually <em>very</em> useful and one of the easier divide-and-conquer algorithms to understand. It's easier to conceptualize than some of the other ones. A key to merge sort is that it is <em>recursive</em>. If you're struggling to grasp recursion, this is going to be doubly hard to understand this algorithm.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The basic gist of merge sort is that you're going to take your big list, and first divide down in two half size lists and recursively call merge sort on those smaller list, which in turn will do the same. The base case is when you have a list of one, at which point you will return that sorted list of one. On the way up the recursive calls, you will merge those sorted lists together (preferably by another merge function you'll write) that walks through both lists simaltaneously and inserts the smaller value first, effectively creating a bigger sorted list.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
[1, 5, 6] sublist 1
[2, 7, 8] sublist 2

-> compare 1 and 2, take 1 and put it in new list
-> compare 5 and 2, take 2 and put it in new list
-> compare 5 and 7, take 5 and put it in new list
-> compare 6 and 7, take 6 and put it in new list
-> list one has no more elements
   add the rest of list two in order (7 and 8)
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>
                        This combined merge with the divide-and-conquer recursion proves to be pretty effective. When you call <code>Array.prototype.sort</code> it often uses MergeSort (depending on the engine and the types of the elements in the array.) MergeSort is also <em>stable</em> which just means if you have equivalent elements, it will keep their original order in the array. This is sometimes important and sometimes not.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        MergeSort's Big O is <code>O(n log n)</code>. Weird, right? We obviously have to compare everything once, but we don't have to compare everything to everything like we do with bubble sort. Rather we just to have to compare to their local lists as we sort. Not too bad.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        MergeSort's space complexity is a bit worse than the previous algorithms at <code>O(n)</code> since we have to create new lists as we go. It's not awful but it nonethless a consideration.

                        Quicksort is one of the most useful and powerful sorting algorithms out there, and it's not terribly difficult to conceptualize (compared to some algorithms we're not talking about anyway.) Above I mentioned that occasionally JavaScript doesn't mergesort for <code>Array.prototype.sort</code>. In those other cases, it's usually some variant on quicksort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's another divide-and-conquer, recursive algorithm but it takes a slightly different approach. The basic gist is that you take the last element in the list and call that the pivot. Everything that's smaller than the pivot gets put into a "left" list and everything that's greater get's put in a "right" list. You then call quick sort on the left and right lists independently (hence the recursion.) After those two sorts come back, you concatenate the sorted left list, the pivot, and then the right list (in that order.) The base case is when you have a list of length 1 or 0, where you just return the list given to you.
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>
[4,9,3,5] list
-> 5 is made the pivot since it's the last in the array
-> divide list into two lists, [4,3] and [9]
-> call quicksort on those two lists

[4, 3]
-> 3 is pivot
-> call quicksort on [] and [4]
-> those both return as is as they are the base case of length 0 or 1
-> concat [], 3, and [4]
-> return [3,4]

[9]
-> returns as this it is a base case of length 1

(back into the original function call)
-> call concat on [3,4], 5, and [9]
-> return [3,4,5,9]
                    </code></pre>

                        Another Big O of <code>O(n log n)</code> but takes up less memory than mergesort so it is often favored. However it does really poorly if you pass it a sorted list. Think about it. It would always have a pivot of the biggest number which defeats the effectiveness of the divide-and-conquer approach as one side will always contain all the elements. Hence not good for lists you expect may already be sorted. There are some tricks to employ to get around that like checking the beginning, middle, and end numbers and swapping them to try to get the best pivot, but that's outside our scope today. There are a lot of subtle variants on quicksort.

                        We are going to talk about two types of implementations of array, ArrayList and LinkedList (terms we're borrowing from Java.) What we're going to do is to approximate how these work underneath the hood; in reality since JavaScript is a garbage-collected language that you don't have worry about allocation and de-allocation, it is simplified.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ArrayList is done by directly interacting with an allocated piece of memory. You then interact with that allocated piece of memory by addressing the specific indicies in the array. In other words, you just treat it like a normal array. However things get a mite more complicated when delete items from an ArrayList: you have the collapse the list down the spot where you deleted.

                        <pre><code>
[a,b,c,d,e,f,g]
-> delete index 3
-> array is [a,b,c,(blank),e,f,g]
-> shift elements 4,5,6 back one index
-> array is [a,b,c,e,f,g]
-> decrement length
                        </code></pre>

                        For our second data structure, we're going to implement a LinkedList. LinkedList is made of a bunch of nodes that point to the next one in the list. Every node in a LinkedLists has two properties, the value of whatever is being store and a pointer to the next node in the list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        LinkedLists have their ups and downs. On one hand, adding and removing is a breeze: you just have the change the next pointer on the previous node and that's it. Getting is a pain though: if <code>.get</code> is called you have to loop through the nodes until you get to the right node. And that's the tradeoff between LinkedList and ArrayList: LinkedList's adds and deletes are <code>O(1)</code> but the gets are <code>O(n)</code>; ArrayList's adds and deletes are <code>O(n)</code> but the gets are <code>O(1)</code>. So which one is better? It depends! If you're doing a bunch of adds and deletes but not many gets, stick to LinkedLists. Doing a bunch of gets? ArrayLists. Both? You decide!
                    </p>
                    <p>Let's dissect a delete.</p>
                    <pre><code>
value: [a]   [b]   [c]   [d]
next:  [ ]-> [ ]-> [ ]-> [ ]-> null

-> delete is called on index 2 (value 'c')
-> grab the head (value 'a')
-> loop through the nexts until you get the index
   before the one to be deleted (value 'b')
-> change the the next of index 1 to be the next of index 2
-> decrement length
-> return the value of the deleted node
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
